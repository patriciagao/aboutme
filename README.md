### Customize it!

#### How can I introduce my data?
You can customize the Resume data editing the files under the ```data``` folder. As the app is thought to support different locales you would probably have to edit some stuff in the yml files of the ```locale``` folder.

#### How can I edit the style stuff?
The css assets are organized quite similar to the proposed way in the [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/book/categorizing) guidelines and [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is also used. So it is supposed to be easy to modify any global styling detail.

##### Grid
The app uses [foundation grid](http://foundation.zurb.com/grid.html). If you want to change the layout grid you woud need to edit the ```index.html```file as right now a  semantic markup is not being use. Would be updated soon.

##### Colors
The main colors are taken from a colourlovers [palette](http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/3366389/Ei).

##### Font-family
The default font-family is [OpenSans-Regular](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans)

##### Icons
Icons are taken from two font-icon families: [useiconic](https://useiconic.com/open/) and [mfglabs-iconset](http://mfglabs.github.io/mfglabs-iconset/). The final icon set was generated using [icomoon](http://icomoon.io/) tool.


### TODO
- Change Grid system to use a semantic solution.
- Fix timeline to be able to display more than 6 items on horizontal mode.
